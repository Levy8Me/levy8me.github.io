		<h3>Is There an "Emotional Brain"?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe amygdala is a part of the brain responsible for fear and other emotional responses. It is composed of two parts:
		the lateral nucleus and the central nucleus. The lateral nucleus is the first to receive events from the thalamus,
		while the central nucleus is responsible for producing the physical changes in the body associated with fear. The
		amygdala can be activated by viewing scary, disturbing, sad, or erotic scenes. It is an important part of the brain in
		understanding how humans process and respond to emotional stimuli.</p>
		<h3>Septal Area:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe septal area is an area of the brain that has been the focus of much research in recent years. It is believed to be a pleasure
		center, and more recently, possibly a curiosity center. This was discovered through self-stimulation studies done on rats. The rats
		would constantly self-stimulate themselves for pleasure when allowed to. They even go as far as to not eat or drink just to stimulate
		themselves. This has been a key finding in understanding the role of the septal area in regard to pleasure and possibly curiosity.</p>
		<h3>Limbic System:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspIt is unlikely that there is a single, distinct area of the brain known as the "limbic system". This is because emotions do not have a
		single, specific area in the brain; they can take many different paths in the brain. Our cerebral cortex can elicit emotions without being
		included in the limbic system, and other parts of the brain contain emotion that are not included in the limbic system. It is more accurate
		to describe emotions as being spread throughout the brain rather than in one area.</p>
