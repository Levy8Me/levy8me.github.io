		<h3>Are Emotions in the Body?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe body plays an important role in emotions. Feelings of love for example can be shown physically through sweating,
		trembling, heart flutters, blushing, muscular tension, crying, and chills. These reactions are controlled by the autonomic nervous system,
		which is a division of the peripheral nervous system that communicates with internal organs and glands. The autonomic nervous system operates
		subconsciously, it provides motor fibers to the brain, smooths cardiac muscles and glands, and causes excitation and inhibition to make adjustments
		to support bodily activities.</p>
		<h3>Nervous System:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe para division and the division are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. The para division is responsible for conserving the
		body's energy and maintaining body activities at basal levels. It is involved in digestion, and defecation, and causes heart rate and blood pressure to be low,
		the skin to be warm, and the pupils to be constricted. It also affects the glands of the head and neck. The division activates the body under conditions of
		fight or flight. It reduces the activity of the immune system, reduces blood flow to organs while increasing blood flow to muscles, and causes the skin
		to become colder while increasing ones heart rate.</p>
		<h3>Emotional Theories:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspSimilar to James Lange's theory from <a href="module3.html">module 3</a> where there are 3 parts that make up how we perceive emotion. There is another
		theory that changes up the steps. The Lay-Persons theory of emotion states that the body's involvement in the emotion process is the last step. It is seen as a "side effect"
		of the emotion, rather than a cause. This theory suggests that emotions are primarily psychological and cognitive processes and that the body's physical reactions are secondary.</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspAgain these aren't the only theories on how we may perceive emotion. One last theory is from Schachter and Singer, their theory suggests that feeling an emotion starts off
		by first having a stimulus causes physical arousal, then we cognitively label our response to the stimulus and associate it to an emotion, and finally we physically feel the emotion.</p>
		<h3>Carbon and Bard:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspCarbon and Bard's critique of the idea that body states are necessary and sufficient for emotion suggests that vagotomized animals should then still show emotion.
		He also states that the autonomic nervous system is too slow to be a component of emotion, and that body changes alone are not sufficient. To test their hypothesis, they created
		an experiment to remove the cortex and/or the diencephalon of a cat, and then they measured the cats response to provocation. The results showed that the cats showed a sham rage, suggesting
		that the cortex and/or diencephalon are not needed in emotion processing and that the cortex might just inhibit emotion.</p>
