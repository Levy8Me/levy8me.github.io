		<h3>Why Study the Biology of Emotion?</h3><img width="400" id="mod1Img1" alt="James-Lange Theory" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vfa95dOg21py68-br4V2hH5CFCZik14409sb-6wx_CuT6O4lW4VFB0ylGbTQTHjtx-L6n8EQLlH64GT1GI2WmB2SkCyjTUqqFvAVFFIzQ8XhIhHCnrRygWPukhMWqoz4BuakJzZT">
		<p>&nbsp&nbspWe continue to look at why we should study the biology of emotion. Why should we anyway?
		Well for one, going back to module 1, if we improve our emotional intelligence we are more able to understand why we feel the way we do
		when we feel the way we do. If our emotional intelligence is high we can better determine how we might cope with our emotions.</p>
		<h3>Different Approaches to Emotion:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe biological approach to understanding behavior focuses on animal research to inform human research. It examines physiology
		and investigates inheritance to better understand behavior. A strength of this approach is its scientific rigor, resulting in reliable and
		practical outcomes. However, the approach often fails to account for other influences on behavior, making it a less comprehensive approach.<br><br>
		&nbsp&nbspThe functional approach to emotions seeks to answer two main questions: how are emotions expressed, and where do they come from? To
		answer the first question, data is collected from a broad range of sources, including both humans and animals. This data reveals a great deal
		of continuity between the two, suggesting that emotions are expressed in similar ways across species. To answer the second question, it is suggested
		that emotions first appear as "serviceable habits," which are certain actions that can be of service in certain states of mind. These habits are then
		passed down through heredity.<br><br>
		&nbsp&nbspThe evolutionary approach to emotion focuses on how external factors, such as selection pressures, can affect the survival of oneself or offspring.
		This approach also looks at how adaptations, such as genetically based traits and an organism's ability to reproduce and survive in a given environment,
		can help an organism's fitness. By studying these factors, biologists can gain insight into how species have evolved emotion over time.</p>
		<h3>Darwins approach:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspCharles Darwin's approach to emotion suggests that emotions were once useful for survival, but are now often useless, similar to the appendix.
		Over time, emotions may have gained a social function as well. Darwin proposed that emotions evolved as a way for humans to survive and adapt to their environment.</p>
