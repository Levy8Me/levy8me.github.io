		<h3>Why do we have emotions?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspAccording to Charles Darwin, emotions are a product of evolution. Our emotions and expressions of such are from the natural selection process done over
		many years. It was thought by Darwin that emotions were originally bodily expressions, and that over time they began to serve purposes. One purpose Darwin gave these
		expressions was for communication. When we are upset others can clearly tell and are able to come to our help and possibly provide us with some sort of comfort. Disgust, althought not quite
		used for communication can be seen as evolutionary as is may have been used to distance ourselves from spoiled food or sick people.</p>
		<h3>Evolutionary Psychology:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspEvolutionary psychology focuses on the idea that certain psychological traits have been shaped by natural selection and are therefore shared by all humans.
		It attempts to answer questions such as whether there are "basic" or "natural kinds" of emotions, and whether there are ancient, special-purpose systems we share with other species.
		However, evolutionary psychology has a tendency to tell "just so stories" and have a primary focus on species-centrism, adaptionism, and focus on cognition and cortex.
		While so, it has also been found to ignore the brain and use natural selection as a justification for social Darwinism.</p>
		<h3>Richard Dawkins:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins explores the idea that life is driven by a desire to propagate itself, and that our bodies are essentially robots controlled in part by our genes.
		Dawkins examines how genes control us through our emotions, such as reflex-like responses that are mostly hard to resist, but sometimes we are able to resist them.
		Social motivations such as attachment, assertion, affiliation, and hostility, might suggest that each of these may be an adaptation that has been selected for during evolution.</p>
