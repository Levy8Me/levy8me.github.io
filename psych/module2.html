		<h3>What is emotion?</h3>
		<p>There are multiple components to emotion:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Valence</li>
			<li>Eliciting stimulus ("aboutness")</li>
			<li>Goals/survival</li>
			<li>Multi-faceted response</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Behavior</li>
				<li>Physiological (the biology)</li>
				<li>Subjective experience (difficult to study)</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Mediate our concerns and the enviroment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspEmotions consist of circuits in the mind that are at least partially activated, response systems,
			and a feeling state/process that drives cognition and some kind of action. Emotion also provides the person
			experiencing it information which might also include a cognitive interpretaion of how one perceives said emotion.
			Social communication signals might also motivate approach or advoidance to a particular stimulant.</p>
		<p>The first type of definition is the basic definition of emotion. With this type of definition it is believed that our emotions are hardwired,
		they came from evolution. That our remote anscestors had them and that they are universal. Everyone feels the same happy or sad, etc. There aren't
		any other feelings that might differentiate from place to place or person to person.</p>
		<p>The second type of definition is the constructivist definition of emotion. It's believed that the emotions that we have words for aren't the same
		for everyone, and that we can't just use the same word for what we think is happy or sad, etc. Emotions are subjective to each person,
		not one culture shares the same happy. This type of definition also shines light on the idea that animals don't have feelings like us humans.</p>
		<p>The third type of definition is the objectivist definition of emotion. This type of definition explains that we aren't the only creature that has emotions.
		Animals and people both have emotions and should be treated as such when new research arises between the two. It's believed that emotions can be studied aside
		from what someone is actually feeling. If someone is happy we should find where the emotions might stem from in the mind without actually seeing the reason in
		their mind for being happy.</p>
		<p>Some of module 2 may be mixed into module 1, so go back to module 1 if you dont quite understand module 2</p>
