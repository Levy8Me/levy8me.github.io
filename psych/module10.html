		<h3>Do Individuals Differ in Emotional Biology?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspWe can use technology to measure emotions...to an extent. The circumplex model is a two-dimensional model that can
		be used to measure the intensity and valence of certain words, such as murder, happiness, republican, etc. Depending
		on the nurture someone received throughout life, they might see these words differently than others. By using an fMRI machine
		and showing these words to someone, it is possible to see what parts of the brain light up and how they might feel about the different words. This
		provides insight into how technology can be used to measure emotions, and whether or not we share the same emotional biology.</p>
		<h3>Insula and Amygdala:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe insular cortex (insula) is a part of the brain that is responsible for registering the subjective experiences of bodily
		feedback such as heat pain, heartbeat awareness, and the value of stimuli. This area is unique to each person and is important in understanding
		how we appraise things. The amygdala is another part of the brain that is involved in assessing stimulus intensity regardless of valence,
		meaning it is not just responsible for fear. Both the insula and amygdala are important in understanding how we evaluate our environment and how it affects us.</p>
		<h3>Promotion and Prevention:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspSomeone who is promotion oriented is more sensitive to gains rather than losses, they will see a win as something greater than an "equal" loss.
		If someone is prevention oriented they will see losses as more signifigant than an "equal" gain.
		Some of us may have a heightened emotional state for seeing postive/negative words. Biologically this means that those who see postive words and
		have a strong activiation in the insula when doing so while also having a low activation when shown negative words are more likely to be someone who approaches
		tough situations rather than avoid them (and vise vera). Someone might have an increased activation in their amygdala when they get a bad grade on a test, if this
		activation is stronger than the activation when getting a bad grade on a test they can be considered someone who is promotion oriented. Where if someone is promotion
		oriented they see a gain as more impactful to them rather than a loss (again vise versa).</p>
