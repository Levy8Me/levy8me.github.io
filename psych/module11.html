		<h3>Does Emotion Biology Impact Cognition?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspResearch has explored how one own understanding of language interacts with the body's emotional states to
		rapidly evoke corresponding feelings. It's been found that the body's feedback can have a significant effect on the
		comprehension of emotional language, leading to a range of emotions and cognitive concepts, such as happiness and birthdays.
		Additionally, someone's emotional state can influence the way in which language is understood.</p>
		<h3>Ledoux:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspLedoux's research revealed two different pathways in which a stimulus can lead to an increase in heart rate.
		The first involves the visual cortex, with a signal originating from the eyes and traveling to the hypothalamus and then to
		the amygdala, which sends a signal to the sensory cortical regions to increase heart rate. The second pathway is more direct,
		with the eyes sending a signal directly to the hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to the amygdala, bypassing the visual
		cortex. The two nuclei of the amygdala, the central and the lateral nucleus, are also involved in this process, with both
		having connections to the anterograde and retrograde.</p>
		<h3>Erasing Memories:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThere was an experiment done with propanolol where when given the drug those with a fear of spiders has the fear
		almost completely "deleted" from their minds. The drug blocks a chemical in the brain called norepinephrine that induces fear
		in individuals. Even more so the drug has been found to help those suffering from PTSD. When given the drug those who had experienced
		a traumatic event start to loose the stress of the event, sometimes even forgetting some of the event at all. This is a really big
		milestone into helping many others with many other mental ailments. Eventually we might be able to erase other memories or even
		add new ones in place of them.</p>
