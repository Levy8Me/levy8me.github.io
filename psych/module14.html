		<h3>Does Emotional Biology Impact Well-being?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThere are two types of "movement" to emotion that exist: unconscious and automatic biological reactions, and conscious
		deliberate emotions. It is argued that we should strive to identify ourselves with the second type, by removing
		ourselves from our physical body and focusing on developing character, morality, virtue, rationality and kindness.
		These qualities will help us to have more meaningful, authentic emotions in our lives.</p>
		<h3>Split Brain:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspSplit-brain is a condition where the two halves of the brain, the left and the right, are unable to communicate
		with each other due to damage or severance of the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves connecting them. The left side of the brain is
		responsible for language and higher-level conscious thought, while the right side conveys emotional feelings subconsciously.
		Both sides of the brain are still able to work together or independently when whole, when seperate they may have certain functions that 
		used to work together now only working independently.</p>
		<h3>Consciousness:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe debate over the foundation of consciousness has been ongoing for centuries, with Panksepp (2005) arguing that emotion
		is the basis of consciousness. According to Panksepp, animals share the same neurobiology as humans and are thus conscious of their
		emotions, although humans differ in that they have the ability to reflect on their own consciousness. The function of consciousness
		is to drive automatic associations when making choices and to provide control over these automatic thoughts.</p>
		<h3>Emotional Regulation:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspEmotional regulation is the process of changing the duration or intensity of an emotional event. It is important to note
		that emotions have inertia, making them difficult to control. There are several methods to regulating emotions, such as distractions,
		reappraisal, suppression, and augmentation. Distractions are not always the best option as they can lead to forgetting now and remembering later. 
		Reappraisal involves changing automatic thoughts. Suppression is the modulation of response while augmentation is adding to the idea.</p>
