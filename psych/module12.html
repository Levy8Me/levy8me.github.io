		<h3>What is the Biology of Social Emotions?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspMoral emotions are feelings that motivate us to act on our social knowledge, both in regards to other people's
		needs and our own moral values and social norms. These emotions can prompt us to act even in the absence of negative
		consequences for inaction, and are based on appraisals of behavior.</p>
		<h3>John Haidt:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspJohn Haidt's concept of elevation is a powerful emotion that is elicited by acts of courage, kindness, loyalty,
		or any act of normal beauty. It is sometimes characterized by a calm, relaxed feeling in the chest, sometimes resulting in a
		"choked up" sensation. Elevation is a motivating emotion, inspiring us to emulate the good deeds of others and strive for moral self-improvement.</p>
		<h3>Frontotemporal Dementia:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspFrontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a rare form of dementia caused by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes, including the anterior
		temporal lobe, ventromedial PFC, and limbic structures. While it leads to personality changes such as a lack of empathic concern and inappropriate social
		behavior, executive function remains intact. Early diagnosis is key to managing symptoms and improving quality of life for those affected.<br><br>
		&nbsp&nbspDifferent damaged areas of the brain cause different symptoms. Damage to the anterior temporal lobe results in a lack of cognitive and emotional
		empathy, while damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex impairs decision making. Damage to limbic structures is linked to antisocial behavior.</p>
		<h3>Empathy:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspEmpathy is an essential part of human interaction, allowing us to connect with each other on a deeper level. It is the ability to understand
		and share the feelings of another person, whether through observation or imagination. This ability to place ourselves in someone else's shoes and feel what
		they are feeling is a powerful tool for building relationships and fostering understanding between individuals. Empathy helps us to see the world through
		someone else's eyes and develop compassion for their experiences.</p>
