		<h3>What is the Biology of Emotional Disorder?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspStress can be advantageous as it encourages us to reach our objectives, making us healthier, smarter and happier people. However, too much of a good thing can be a bad thing
		too much stress can lead to allostatic load.</p>
		<h3>Allostatic Load:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspAllostatic load is the cumulative physical and psychological wear and tear our bodies experience as a result of chronic stress.
		Managing allostatic load is essential to maintaining physical and mental health. To do so, it is important to identify and address
		the sources of stress in your life, practice self-care activities to reduce stress, and cultivate healthy coping strategies to manage
		stress more effectively. Additionally, getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate sleep can help reduce
		the strain of allostatic load on the body. By taking steps to manage allostatic load, you can protect your physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
		<h3>Stress:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe adrenal gland is a rapid responder to stress, releasing glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines into the bloodstream, which affects
		metabolism by slowing it down, causes an increase in blood pressure, and prevent the immune system from working properly. Stress can also make you feel hungry
		even when you may not be. The amygdala also plays a role in stress, sending out a distress signal that activates the sympathetic nervous
		system through the autonomic nerves to the adrenal gland. To protect against the effects of chronic stress, activities like meditation or even
		just breathing exercises can be beneficial.</p>
		<h3>Role of the Amygdala:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe amygdala's part in memory formation is that it is activated by emotional arousal, which leads to the alteration of memory storage in
		other brain regions. However, when stressed, people find it more difficult to form short-term memories and store them as long-term ones. Additionally,
		chronic stress can cause overstimulation of the brain, leading to forgetfulness. The hippocampus is also affected by extreme or chronic stress, as its
		neurochemicals, neural activity, and neurogenesis can be altered, influencing learning and memory and resulting in mental issues. Using the same techniques
		as mentioned before you can certainly relieve much of this stress before it has time to build and cause damage.</p>
