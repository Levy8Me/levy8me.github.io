		<h3>Are There Brain Centers for Emotion?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus are all important parts of the brain. The amygdala evaluates the emotional significance
		of sensory input and has unconscious experiences embedded into it, allowing it to remember fear for us. It may also be used for other
		emotions. The thalamus acts as a relay station between incoming sensory and bodily information and the brain, allowing it to process
		sensory input. The hypothalamus is responsible for controlling eating, sexual behavior, aggression, and bodily temperatures, as well
		as influencing the body's hormonal system and autonomic nervous system. Sensations from the outside and inside of the body first go
		through the thalamus and then travel out toward the neocortex, but they also travel out to the limbic system and then to the striatal system.
		Together, these three parts of the brain are responsible for many of our emotional and physical processes.</p>
		<h3>Amygdala:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe Amygdala is a structure located in the temporal lobe of the brain that plays an important role in emotional processing.
		It is responsible for evaluating the emotional significance of sensory input and helps to guide behavior accordingly. Damage or
		removal of the amygdala can lead to Klüver-Bucy Syndrome, a condition characterized by visual agnosia, hyperorality, and hypersexuality.
		Visual agnosia is caused by damage to the ventral “what?” stream of visual processing, which impairs the ability to recognize objects,
		even food. Hyperorality is an oral fixation, while hypersexuality is characterized by incessant masturbation or humping of objects. The
		purpose of emotion is to help individuals respond appropriately to the objects they identify, and the amygdala plays a key role in this process.</p>
		<h3>MacLean:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspMacLean's Triune Brain Theory, proposed in the 1960s, suggests that the human brain is composed of three distinct parts, each representing a different
		evolutionary age. The first part, the Reptilian brain, is the most primitive and is responsible for basic actions and emotional responses. The second part,
		the Paleo-mammalian brain, builds upon the Reptilian brain by adding social emotions and more complex emotional responses. Finally, the third part,
		the Neo-mammalian brain, provides top-down control over the more basic responses of the other two parts. Together, these three parts make up the modern human brain.
		MacLean's Limbic Brain Hypothesis proposes that the limbic system, originally referred to as the "visceral" brain, is distinct from brain areas that serve cognition,
		and is responsible for integrating input from the world and body. This integration generates emotional experience. The thalamus is connected to the striatal system,
		the neocortex, and the limbic system. The striatal system is responsible for the stream of movement, the neocortex for the stream of thought, and the limbic system
		for the stream of feeling (particularly to the hypothalamus). According to MacLean, events in the world lead to bodily changes which are signaled to the brain and
		integrated with ongoing sensory input to generate an emotional experience.</p>
