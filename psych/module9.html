		<h3>Are There Brain Systems for Emotion?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe brain is composed of two main systems that allow it to function: neural pathways and neuromodulators.
		Neural pathways are discrete pathways through the brain that lead to the activation of different areas, structures,
		and cells. One example of a neural pathway is the midbrain reward system. Neuromodulators, on the other hand, activate
		the same areas, structures, and cells as neural pathways, but by different types of neurotransmitters. An example of a
		neuromodulator is serotonin.</p>
		<h3>Inter-neuronal Transmission:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspInter-neuronal transmission is the process of communication between neurons. It can be regulated by external drugs,
		such as agonists which increase neural firing, and antagonists which reduce neural firing and block the site. Endogenous
		substances, such as neurotransmitters, are also involved in inter-neuronal transmission. These substances can have lasting
		effects, such as altering the default firing rate, synaptic efficacy, and bursting activity. Neuromodulators, such as dopamine,
		serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, cannabinoids, and neuropeptides are also involved in inter-neuronal transmission.
		Neuropeptides are larger and longer acting than neurotransmitters, and there are hundreds of them.<br><br>
		Example: When we use an addictive drug or experience a reward our ventral tegmental area neurons become activated.
		These neurons are then exchanged over to the nucleus accumbens which causes dopamine in the accumbens to rise.
		This process can also be triggered when we listen to music, the experiment for this explained that people who had more
		activation in the accumbens after hearing new music were more likely to buy the music later on.</p>
		<h3>Pleasure Center:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThe pleasure center of the brain is located in the medial forebrain bundle, a bundle of axons situated in the
		middle of the brain between the midbrain (upper brainstem) and forebrain (cortex). Stimulation of this area has been shown
		to produce rapid antidepressant effects, making it an important target for further research on the treatment of depression.</p>
		<h3>Single-cell Recording:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspSingle-cell recording is a method of recording neuron action potentials using a microelectrode from multiple
		sites within the brain during a specific task. This technique allows researchers to determine the neuron's firing properties,
		which can then be plotted on a roster diagram. This diagram provides an overview of the neuron's activity and helps scientists
		better understand how neurons interact with each other within the brain.</p>
