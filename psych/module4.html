		<h3>How can emotions be studied?</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspNow we find ourselves asking, how can we study emotion?
		Well, there are many different approaches to studying emotion. However, the most scientific one will be used here.
		The comparative method is considered the most scientific approach and takes in account that animal research informs human research.
		A flaw to consider when using this method is that is fails to account for other influences on behavior.</p>
		<h3>Ethics:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspQuickly before we discuss what Jaak Panksepps study had found we have to
		ask ourselves, what might be some ethical concerns when studying the psychology of people or animals? 
		One ethical issue that arises when conducting emotional research on humans is, we don't want to cause mental trauma to people from such experimentation.
		Another ethical issue would be that the subjects might have underlying mental problems that through this experiment might surface causing issues for
		said subject later down the road. When we conduct research we want to make sure we aren't harming the people giving us new insight. We also might want to make sure
		that we keep the animals we do use for research safe and resourceful, as to not let them be harmed for no output.</p>
		<h3>Jaak Panksepp:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspNow let's look at a study done by Jaak Panksepp in the late 1990s. Himself and some colleagues discovered that when rats were tickled
		they emitted an ultrasonic sound. Almost as if they were giggling and expressing happiness. These rats emitted the sound in their everyday lives but
		it was only more frequently when being tickled by a person. Not only did they enjoy the tickling in the moment, but they were found to come back and want more. The only way we were
		able to hear these laughs were through the technology we developed. Our ears alone can't hear the high pitch laughs that these rats emit. However, by using a certain recording device
		we can absolutely hear the little laughs from our furry rodents.</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspTechnology advancement allows us to advance ourselves with neuroscience. Advances in neuroscience then allows us to help solidify psychological theory.
		Neuroscience provides us with breakthroughs that can challenge classical ways of thinking. Psychology in itself provides us with meaningful insight into the various different human behaviors.</p>
