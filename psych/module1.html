		<h2>Module 1</h2><img width="256" alt="Plutchik-wheel" id='mod1Img1' src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/512px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png"><h3>What does emotion mean?</h3>
		<p>Us humans are built for survival, we want to belong and we thrive to become.<br><br>
		&nbsp&nbspWithout emotion we have a lesser ability to communicate with each other. When we're sad, someone nearby might step over and ask what's wrong. When we're angry someone might be afraid to ask what's wrong.
		How might that work without our facial expressions for emotion? Some people have a high intillectual intelligence, however, intillectual intelligence isn't all thats important. Having a high emotional intelligence is also a very saught after skill.</p>
		<h3>Emotional Intelligence:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspPeople with high emotional intelligence are typically skilled in self-management, self-awareness, social-awareness, empathy, relationship management, leading a diverse team and leading a team to completion of goals. To have a higher emotional intelligence,
		one must better themselves in any of these areas. Not mentioned above, you can also learn more about emotion itself (specifically the biology behind it) to also achieve a higher emotional intelligence.</p>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspI'ts often thought that emotions are binary in that we think of them as either completely happy/sad or angry/neutral. This is not the case at all. There are dimensions to emotions for example, sometimes you might feel happy but also excited.
		Emotions live on a spectrum just like Plutchik's wheel of emotions (see above-right), they are constantly shifting based on the stimuli or thoughts that activate them.
		</p>
		<h3>Definitions for Emotion:</h3>
		<p>&nbsp&nbspThere are three different definitions of emotion. The first definition is the evolutionist definition which views emotion as discrete, natural responses that are biologically driven, and having specific facial expressions.
		The second is the constructivist definition which views emotion as a social construct, subject to culture, and does not consider animal research in its analysis. The third and final definition is the objectivist definition it looks at both
		human and animal emotions, using animal research to inform human research, and focusing mainly on objective properties.</p>
